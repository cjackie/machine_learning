### Naive Bayes classifier
Naive Bayes assumes that input features are independent in probability, which is a strong assumption. The size of input features is fixed, which can be very large(more than 1000s). But the output is just binary. Naive Bayes classifier uses the bayse rule as the model to make predictions.

### Linear Regression
The most simple yet powerful model for mapping data. It assumes the outputs are linearly depended on data with gaussian noise. The data itself can be transformed or even mapped to higher dimensions, and the same algorithm can be applied.

### Logistic Regression
A model with the output being only 2 possible states(binary output).
