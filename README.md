### Naive Bayes classifier
Naive Bayes assumes that input features are independent in probability, which is a strong assumption. The size of input features is fixed, which can be very large(more than 1000s). But the output is just binary. Naive Bayes classifier uses the bayse rule as the model to make predictions.
